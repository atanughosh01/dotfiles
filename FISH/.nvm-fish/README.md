# Node Version Manager for fish 2.1.0+

## Important Note

nvm-fish is a port of [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) for fish shell.
Although it is fully functional, it should be considered very beta, so you use it on your own risk!
Please report any bugs you encounter. Please always specify your OS and fish shell version when reporting bugs.

## Installation

First you'll need to make sure your system has a c++ compiler.  For OSX, XCode will work, for Ubuntu, the build-essential and libssl-dev packages work.

### Install script

To install you could use the [install script](https://github.com/Alex7Kom/nvm-fish/blob/master/install.fish) (requires Git) using cURL:

    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alex7Kom/nvm-fish/master/install.fish | fish

or Wget:

    wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alex7Kom/nvm-fish/master/install.fish | fish

<sub>The script clones the nvm repository to `~/.nvm-fish` and adds the source line to your config (`~/.config/fish/config.fish`).</sub>


### Manual install

For manual install create a folder somewhere in your filesystem with the `nvm.fish` file inside it.  I put mine in a folder called `nvm-fish`.

Or if you have `git` installed, then just clone it:

    git clone https://github.com/Alex7Kom/nvm-fish.git ~/.nvm-fish

To activate nvm, you need to source it from your shell:

    source ~/.nvm-fish/nvm.fish

I always add this line to my `~/.config/fish/config.fish` file to have it automatically sourced upon login.
Often I also put in a line to use a specific version of node.

## Usage

You can create an `.nvmrc` file containing version number in the project root directory (or any parent directory).
`nvm use`, `nvm install`, and `nvm run` will all respect an `.nvmrc` file.

To download, compile, and install the latest v0.10.x release of node, do this:

    nvm install 0.10

And then in any new shell just use the installed version:

    nvm use 0.10

Or you can just run it:

    nvm run 0.10 --version

If you want to see what versions are installed:

    nvm ls

If you want to see what versions are available to install:

    nvm ls-remote

To restore your PATH, you can deactivate it.

    nvm deactivate

To set a default Node version to be used in any new shell, use the alias 'default':

    nvm alias default 0.10

To use a mirror of the node binaries, set `$NVM_NODEJS_ORG_MIRROR`:

    set NVM_NODEJS_ORG_MIRROR http://nodejs.org/dist
    nvm install 0.10

## Problems

If you try to install a node version and the installation fails, be sure to delete the node downloads from src (~/.nvm-fish/src/) or you might get an error when trying to reinstall them again or you might get an error like the following:

    curl: (33) HTTP server doesn't seem to support byte ranges. Cannot resume.

Where's my 'sudo node'? Checkout this link:

https://github.com/creationix/nvm/issues/43

on Arch Linux and other systems using python3 by default, before running *install* you need to

    set PYTHON python2

After the v0.8.6 release of node, nvm tries to install from binary packages. But in some systems, the official binary packages don't work due to incompatibility of shared libs. In such cases, use `-s` option to force install from source:

    nvm install -s 0.8.6
